#  Introduction
Hey! This is a compilation of implementations of algorithms and data structures that I commonly use on programming contests. Each snippet of code contains some description of the technique used, followed by an implementation of a typical problem, and some examples of other applications of the technique.
This was made to give USACO and other contestants an idea of standard techniques to learn in a centralized location, and also something I can refer to during Codeforces contests.
If you're interested in learning any of the techniques more thoroughly, feel free to contact me @ kyleliu11111@gmail.com.
